# Game Score Leaderboard Proof-of-Concept

This is a **proof-of-concept project** that demonstrates a static frontend hosted on GitHub Pages interacting with a backend API to store and display player scores for multiple games.

---

## Features

- **Game Website**: Submit player scores via a simple form.
- **Viewer / Leaderboard Website**: View top 10 scores per game, or overall top 10 across all games, with auto-refresh.
- **Backend API**: Node.js + Express server with SQLite database.
- **Database**: SQLite stores player names, game names, scores, and timestamps.
- **Frontend**: Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Works locally or can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Database**: SQLite (`better-sqlite3`)  
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (frontend only)

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd project-root/backend

2. Install backend dependencies

npm install

3. Start the backend server

node server.js

    Backend API will run at: http://localhost:5000

    Database scores.db will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

4. Open frontend websites

    Game website: frontend/game/index.html

    Viewer / Leaderboard website: frontend/viewer/index.html

    Note: Frontend uses http://localhost:5000 as API URL for dev/testing.

API Endpoints
POST /api/scores

Add a player score.

Request body (JSON):

}

GET /api/scores

Retrieve scores, optionally filtered by game.

Query parameters:

    "game": "Snake",
    "score": 123,
    "created_at": "2026-01-23T12:34:56Z"
  }
]

Future Improvements

    Host backend publicly (Cloudflare Tunnel / domain) for GitHub Pages frontend.

    Add authentication for secure score submissions.

    Enhance leaderboard UI with badges for top 3 ranks.

    Add multiple games or different game modes.

    Deploy backend to Raspberry Pi for local network testing.
